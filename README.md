#HatNameGame<br />
This program will allow a user to enter a name into a virtual hat.  The user can enter as many names as they'd like.
The same name cannot be entered more than once.  The user can then click a button which will draw a name from the virtual hat.
The name drawn will be displayed to the user temporarily.
