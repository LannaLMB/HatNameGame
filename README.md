#HatNameGame<br />
This program will allow a user to enter a name into a virtual hat.  The user can enter as many names as they'd like.
A name cannot be entered more than once.  The user can then choose a name from the virtual hat by choosing a number 
within the range of names entered.  The name drawn will then be displayed to the user temporarily.
